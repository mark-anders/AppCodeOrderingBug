# Contributing to LogKit

The LogKit Project welcomes contributions from the community! Please review this document to understand how to participate in the project.

## Security Issues

Please do **not** file public issues for security concerns. Instead, please email your report privately to <security@logkit.info>. This will allow us to fix the issue and release an update before exposing the issue. Once an update has been released, we will work with you to publish the issue and get the credit you deserve.

## Other Contributions

We welcome pull requests, issues, and discussion from the community. Please be detailed!

Before creating a new issue, please have a search through the issue tracker to be sure it doesn't already exist. If it does, please leave a comment letting us know that you are also experiencing that issue, and adding any additional detail that could help. This will assist us in prioritizing issues, and fixing them as quickly as possible.
